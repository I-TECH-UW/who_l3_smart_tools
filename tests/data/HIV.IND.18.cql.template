 * Additional Context
 * - what it measures: This measures the number and percentage of people living with HIV who have been tested and know their HIV status.
 * - rationale: • Knowledge of HIV status is the entry point for people living with HIV to treatment and the continuum of care, and for those who test HIV-negative and remain at elevated risk of HIV acquisition, to prevention interventions. | • Disaggregated estimates can reveal gaps in access to testing among important groups of people living with HIV
 * - method: For the numerator: Best estimate based on available data sources |  | 1. Direct estimates from HIV case surveillance systems of the number of people living with HIV diagnosed with HIV, reported by a surveillance system and who are still alive. HIV case surveillance data can be used if reporting from all facilities providing confirmatory HIV testing and treatment services has been in place since at least 2014 and if people who have died, been lost to follow-up, etc., are removed from the numerator. Only confirmed HIV diagnoses should be counted. Mechanisms should be in place to de-duplicate individuals reported multiple times or from multiple facilities. |  | 2. Modelled estimates, for which the modelling approach depends on the availability of country data. For countries with robust case surveillance and vital registration systems, the number of people who know their HIV status can be derived using the Case Surveillance and Vital Registration (CSAVR) fitting tool in the Spectrum AIDS Impact Module (AIM). For countries with household population survey data that either directly capture the number of HIV-positive respondents who report that they know their status or the number of HIV- positive people who report ever having been tested, UNAIDS recommends (as of 2018) that the first 90 be modelled using the Shiny First 90.*
